title: Box Smasher 1.1.1 released
---

Hello! Box Smasher 1.1.1 has just been released. It is primarily a patch release to fix some issues that were discovered in the game with the F-Droid release for Android, some bugs more serious than others.

<!--more-->

The most important issue that has been fixed is that the screen would be oversized on Android 15, making the game more or less unplayable there. But it also contains some other bugfixes across platforms that I managed to get in, and also seven new levels to play bringing the total number of levels up to a round 24!

The new version is now available on itch.io, and the F-Droid version will be updated within a couple days. See the [Download](/download/) page for links.

## Changelog

- Add 7 new levels
- Fix game window being cut off on Android 15+ ([#1](https://github.com/rollerozxa/boxsmasher/issues/1))
- Fix game not starting back up after being exited on Android
- Fix buttons triggering when they shouldn't be
- Fix thrown balls changing colour to the last thrown ball
- Fix fullscreen setting not saving in settings
- Code refactoring and misc. cleanups

And probably more stuff I forgot... You can view the full commit history [here](https://github.com/rollerozxa/boxsmasher/commits/1.1.1).
