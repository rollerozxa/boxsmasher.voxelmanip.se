Welcome to the new Box Smasher website. This site will serve as the new central point for the game as the game's development continues.

The last proper version of Box Smasher was v1.0.1 released all the way back on the 25th of May 2023, almost two years ago. While the game's development has not been consistently active during those years, there has been various changes to the game, bugfixes and new levels that have collected up in the Git repository meanwhile. It has been my plan for quite some time to pick Box Smasher back up and continue development, this new website being part of that.

This website is also being made in preparation for Box Smasher soon being taken down by Google from the Play Store. While it always was nice seeing the game available on Google Play, their new developer policies are way too invasive to comply with, and once the deadline rolls around (3th February 2025) all my apps including Box Smasher will be taken down and made unavailable.

It is my hope that I will be able to release a full v1.1 version of Box Smasher sometime in the future incorporating the changes and fixes that will have been made during the 2 years since the original school project was completed. And addition to being available for download on itch.io, I wish to also be able to bring Box Smasher to F-Droid.

But until then, I have made available a latest development version on the download page in the form of a simple universal LÃ–VE package.
