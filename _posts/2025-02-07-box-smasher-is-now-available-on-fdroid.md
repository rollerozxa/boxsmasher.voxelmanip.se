Box Smasher is now officially available on F-Droid, an alternative app store for Android focusing on Free and open source apps.

While it was submitted to F-Droid right around the time that 1.1.0 was released, the F-Droid release process can take some days as they build all apps completely from source rather than reusing prebuilt binaries from the app developers. But the wait is now over as just an hour or so after I woke up today, I saw that the app had been signed and pushed to the F-Droid repository, and now it has also made it onto the F-Droid website.

The [download page](/download/) has been updated to feature the beautiful F-Droid download badge now. You can also go to the F-Droid page for Box Smasher here:

While Google Play unfortunately remains a de facto monopoly when it comes to Android app distribution, F-Droid is the perfect fit for Free and open source apps like Box Smasher when it is no longer welcome on Google Play. Hopefully this can compensate for the loss of Box Smasher on Google Play, as you will conveniently get new updates for the game through F-Droid once they come out.
