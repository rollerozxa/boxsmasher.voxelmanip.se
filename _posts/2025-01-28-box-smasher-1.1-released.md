title: Box Smasher 1.1.0 released
---

Hello! Box Smasher 1.1.0 has just been released. Being the first release in about two years, it contains a lot of changes that have been accumulated over that time.

<!--more-->

This version will not be available on Google Play as Google has prevented me from pushing updates to the game. However, Google will permanently remove Box Smasher from Google Play in about a week's time anyways.

In order to compensate for the loss of Google Play as a distribution method for Android users, I have submitted Box Smasher for inclusion to F-Droid. The app has been accepted and merged, and 1.1.0 will soon show up within a couple days.

Other than that, downloads for the game are now available on [itch.io](https://rollerozxa.itch.io/box-smasher). A 64-bit Windows binary, 64-bit Linux AppImage and Android APK is provided as well as an universal LÖVE package to run the game with your own provided LÖVE runtime.

## Changelog

- 5 new levels!
- Add statistics, tracking various metrics throughout the game
- Add settings for toggling fullscreen and sound
- Fullscreen can also be toggled with F11
- Add quick tutorial on the first level
- Add fade effect on scene transition
- Add intro card on game startup
- Add more sound effects for gameplay interactions
- Handle the back button being pressed on Android
- Fix bug where throwing balls became impossible
- License the game under GPLv3
